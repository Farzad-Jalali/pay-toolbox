          this is a low severity exploit that allows crafted user input to
          manipulate type detection. kind-of is used at very low level by
          nunjucks. We validate user input using Joi, and generally only access
          specified fields in njk templates. In any case exploiting this
          vulnerability in this context does not seem to carry any threat.
